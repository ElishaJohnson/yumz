## Overview

This program provides a searchable database of restaurant ratings and reviews. Users can rate different aspects of a restaurant (food, service, & atmosphere) on a scale of 0 to 5 stars, and are able to view & sort results based on the average star rating in any or all of the available categories.

The thing that sets this apart from other rating systems is its personalized customization of a user's search results. The user can select the priority of each category and the database will return weighted overall average ratings based on the user's settings, allowing the user to tailor their dining experience to their immediate individual needs.
